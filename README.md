# Admin Dashboard

Admin Dashboard is a CRUD application that was created with PHP & MYSQL
You are free to use this as a boilerplate for your own projects.

I used Bootstrap 5 for simplicity, however, I do intend to update the UI, as well as add more features in the future.

Any constructive criticism is greatly appreciated.
